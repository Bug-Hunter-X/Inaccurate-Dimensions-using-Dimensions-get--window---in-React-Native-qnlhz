This React Native code uses `Dimensions.get('window')` to get the screen dimensions.  However, this approach doesn't always work reliably, especially when dealing with dynamic screen orientations or updates that occur after the component has mounted.  This can result in inaccurate dimensions and layout issues.

```javascript
import { Dimensions, View, Text } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');

  return (
    <View style={{ width, height, backgroundColor: 'blue' }}>
      <Text>Component</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
